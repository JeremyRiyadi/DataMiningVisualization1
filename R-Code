### Calls the libraries and functions used

```{r}
source("explorationFunction.R") # for BasicSummary function

library(corrplot) # to create a correlation plot to look for correlation between variables

library(ggplot2) # to create a plot: bar plot, scatter plot
library(dplyr) # for data manipulation and transformation: filter(), group_by(), others
```

### Opens a CSV file and converts it to a dataframe

```{r}
x = read.csv("WHR_2023.csv")
df = data.frame(x)
```

Displays a dataframe so it is easy to see what data is contained in it.
It is known that the dataframe has 137 rows and 9 columns.

## View variable characters

```{r}
str(df)
```

The dataframe has 137 observations with 9 variables, 2 categorical and 7 numerical.
The two categorical variables, namely country and region, have character data types.
Meanwhile, the numerical variables consist of happiness_score, gdp_per_capita, social_support, healthy_life_expectancy, freedom_to_make_life_choices, generosity, and perceptions_of_corruption.
The first 5 data for each variable in the dataframe are also displayed.

```{r}
summary(df)
```

Displays summary data in the dataframe, in the form of the mean, 5 number summary, and the number of missing values(NA).
It can be seen that for the variable healthy_life_expectancy there is 1 null value.

## Check and delete null values

```{r}
sum(is.na(df))
which(!complete.cases(df)) # palestine -> healthy_life_expectancy (row 99)

df <- df[-99, ]
rownames(df) <- seq_len(nrow(df)) 
# so that the index is directly connected
```

There was 1 null value in row 99 column 5, which was then deleted, so the dataframe now has 136 rows and 9 columns.

### Check duplicated values

```{r}
duplicated(df) #no duplication
```

There are no duplicate values.

### Looking for outliers in the happiness_score variable

```{r}
FindOutliers(df$happiness_score)
```

According to the Three Sigma method there is 1 outlier.
According to the Hampel method, there is 1 outlier.
According to the Boxplot Rule there are 9 outliers.

### Removing outliers (using Z score)

```{r}
sd(df$happiness_score) # standard deviation before outliers are removed

threshold <- sd(df$happiness_score) * 3

# Remove rows with happiness_score values greater than the threshold
dfCleaned <- df %>%
  filter(abs(happiness_score - mean(happiness_score)) < threshold)

sd(dfCleaned$happiness_score) # standar deviasi setelah outlier dihapus
```

Standard deviation before the outlier is removed = 1.142841 Standard deviation after the outlier is removed = 1.101689 Because the difference is only 0.04, the outlier does not have much effect on the data so it does not need to be removed

### Looking for outliers in the gdp_per_capita variable

```{r}
FindOutliers(df$gdp_per_capita)
```

According to the Three Sigma method there is 1 outlier.
According to the Hampel method there are 0 outliers.
According to the Boxplot Rule there are 10 outliers.

### Looking for outliers in the social_support variable

```{r}
FindOutliers(df$social_support)
```

According to the Three Sigma method there is 1 outlier.
According to the Hampel method, there are 2 outliers.
According to the Boxplot Rule there are 18 outliers.

### Looking for outliers in the healthy_life_expectancy variable

```{r}
FindOutliers(df$healthy_life_expectancy)
```

According to the Three Sigma method there are 0 outliers.
According to the Hampel method there are 0 outliers.
According to the Boxplot Rule there are 15 outliers.

### Looking for outliers in the freedom_to_make_life_choices variable

```{r}
FindOutliers(df$freedom_to_make_life_choices)
```

According to the Three Sigma method there is 1 outlier.
According to the Hampel method, there is 1 outlier.
According to the Boxplot Rule there are 13 outliers.

### Look for outliers in the loyalty variable

```{r}
FindOutliers(df$generosity)
```

According to the Three Sigma method there are 2 outliers.
According to the Hampel method, there are 2 outliers.
According to the Boxplot Rule there are 12 outliers.

### Looking for outliers in the perception_of_corruption variable

```{r}
FindOutliers(df$perceptions_of_corruption)
```

According to the Three Sigma method there are 2 outliers.
According to the Hampel method there are 12 outliers.
According to the Boxplot Rule there are 11 outliers.

### View correlation between numerical variables

```{r}
newDf <- subset(df, select = -c(region, country))

c <- cor(newDf)
corrplot(c, type="upper", method="number")
```

Correlation plot displays the correlation between variables.
The darker the color and the closer the number is to -1.0 or 1.0, the greater the correlation between the variables.
For example, the correlation between happiness_score and gdp_per_capta is 0.78.
Because 0.78 is close to 1.0, happiness_score and gdp_per_capita are strongly correlated.
Meanwhile, the correlation between healthy_life_expectancy and generosity is only 0.14, therefore the correlation is weak.
It can be concluded that the happiness_score variable has a strong correlation with gdp_per_capita, social_support, healthy_life_expectancy, and freedom_to_make_life_choices.

### Correlation tests on several variables to prove the correlation plot

```{r}
cor.test(newDf$happiness_score, newDf$gdp_per_capita, method = c("pearson")) #0.7843422
cor.test(newDf$gdp_per_capita, newDf$social_support, method = c("pearson")) #0.7379928
cor.test(newDf$gdp_per_capita, newDf$healthy_life_expectancy, method = c("pearson")) #0.8375183 
cor.test(newDf$happiness_score, newDf$healthy_life_expectancy, method = c("pearson")) #0.7466993
```

The first result shows that the correlation between the happiness_score variable and gdp_per_capita is 0.7838113, meaning it is strongly correlated.
The second result shows that the correlation between the gdp_per_capita variable and social_support is 0.7417151, meaning it is strongly correlated.
The third result shows that the correlation between the happiness_score and healthy_life_expectancy variables is 0.8375183, meaning that they are strongly correlated.
The fourth result shows that the correlation between the happiness_score and healthy_life_expectancy variables is 0.7466993, meaning that they are strongly correlated.

### Average happiness score by region

```{r}
happinessByRegion <- df %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarize(mean_happiness = mean(happiness_score, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(happinessByRegion, 
       aes(x = reorder(region, -mean_happiness), y = mean_happiness)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#458B74", color = "gray") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_happiness, 2)), vjust = -0.5) +
  labs(x = "Region", y = "Mean Happiness Score", title = "Mean Happiness Score by Region") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The bar plot shows a comparison between the average happiness_score per region.
It was found that North America and ANZ (Australia and New Zealand) had the highest happiness_score of 7.02.

### Highest Happiness score by country (\>7.0)

```{r}
filtered_data <- df %>%
  filter(happiness_score >= 7.0)

ggplot(filtered_data, 
       aes(x = reorder(country, -happiness_score), y = happiness_score)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#458B74", color = "gray") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(happiness_score, 2)), vjust = -0.5) +
  labs(x = "Region", y = "Mean Happiness Score", title = "Top Happiness Score by Country") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The bar plot shows countries with a happiness_score above 7.0, consisting of 12 countries, namely Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Israel, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Austria and Australia.

## Comparing Indonesian Data with Other Countries

```{r}
#filter indonesia data
indonesias <- df %>%
  filter(country == "Indonesia")

others <- df %>%
  filter(country != "Indonesia")

rows <- c("happiness_score", "gdp_per_capita", "social_support", "healthy_life_expectancy", "freedom_to_make_life_choices", "generosity", "perceptions_of_corruption")

comparison <- data.frame(Index = rows,
  Indonesia = c(indonesias$happiness_score, indonesias$gdp_per_capita, indonesias$social_support, indonesias$healthy_life_expectancy, indonesias$freedom_to_make_life_choices, indonesias$generosity, indonesias$perceptions_of_corruption),
  Other = c(mean(others$happiness_score), mean(others$gdp_per_capita), mean(others$social_support), mean(others$healthy_life_expectancy), mean(others$freedom_to_make_life_choices), mean(others$generosity), mean(others$perceptions_of_corruption))
)
comparison

```

Dataframe comparison compares the values ​​of each variable for Indonesia with other countries.
With this dataframe, we can compare the condition of Indonesia's happiness rate with other countries and the variables that influence it.
Based on the dataframe comparison above, Indonesia's happiness_score is slightly below the average happiness_score of other countries, as well as variables such as gdp_per_capita, healthy_life_expectancy, and perceptions_of_corruption.
Meanwhile, variables such as social_support, freedom_to_make_life_choices, and generosity are slightly above the average for other countries.
Thus, Indonesia's overall happiness_score is 5,277.
The comparison dataframe is then visualized in the bar plot below.

```{r}
comparison_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(comparison, cols = c(Indonesia, Other),
                                       names_to = "Country", values_to = "Value")

ggplot(comparison_long, aes(x = Value, y = Index, fill = Country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Factors between Indonesia and Other Countries",
       x = "Value", y = "Index") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Indonesia" = "red", "Other" = "grey")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Conclusion

From the World Happiness Records 2023 dataset, it can be concluded that the country with the highest happiness record is Finland, with a happiness score of 7,804.
Meanwhile, there are 12 countries with a happiness record of more than 7.0, namely, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Israel, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Austria, Australia.

After carrying out a correlation test, it was found that the variables that were strongly correlated with a country's happiness score were GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices, with a correlation value close to 1.0.

Meanwhile, all variables are linearly correlated with each other.
Most are positively correlated, where when variable 1 increases, variable 2 also increases.
However, the GDP per capita variable with generosity and also the healthy life expectancy variable with generosity are negatively correlated, that is, when variable 1 rises, variable 2 actually falls.

Therefore, in conclusion, a country's happiness score is influenced by the following factors: how big a country's GDP per capita is, the quality of social support offered by a country and the quality of a person's social life, how high a country's healthy life expectancy is, and also how much opportunity a person has to make a decision.

Indonesia has a happiness_score of 5,277 which is slightly below the average happiness_score of other countries.
This is not too bad, but there are still many factors that can be improved so that Indonesia's happiness_score can increase, such as in terms of the level of corruption, healthy life expectancy, and GDP per capita.
